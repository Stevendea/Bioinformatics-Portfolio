The following are projects and assignments completed for Phylogenetic Analysis of a series of organisms. The gene I chose to
analyze in various organisms is that of APOE in search of a better model organism to study Alzheimer's Disease.
All of the images generated in these files come from analysis tools such as MEGAX, MST-GOLD, BEAUti, FigTree, MUSCLE, ClustalW, and GUIDANCE2.
